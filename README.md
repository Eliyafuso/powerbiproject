# ‚úàÔ∏è Air Flights Delay Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing air flight delays across the United States. It was developed as part of a **group assignment** for the Data Analytics program at Mohawk College, using real-world data from **Kaggle**.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle 
- **Scope**: Flight data from 2003 to 2022  
- **Records Analyzed**: Over 121 million flights  
- **Key Variables**: Delay reason, delay duration, flight status, carrier, airport, city/state

---

## üìä Dashboard Sections

### 1. **General Flight Information**
- Total Carriers: 28  
- Total Airports: 416  
- Total Cities: 389  
- Average Delay: 4.24K mins  
- Delayed Flights: 19.74%

Includes:
- Delay distribution by type (On Time, Late, Diverted, Cancelled)
- U.S. delay concentration map
- Yearly trend of late flights

---

### 2. **Indicator Analysis by Cause**
- Main causes of delays:
  - **Previous flight** (37.96%) ‚Äì the most significant
  - NAS (National Aviation System), Carrier, Weather, Security
- Visualizations:
  - Delay duration per carrier
  - Average delay by cause over time
  - State-level delay summaries

---

### 3. **Indicator Analysis Across the USA**
- Total Flights: 121M  
- Delayed Flights: 23M (19.07%)  
- Top Delay Sources:
  - States: NJ, IL, GA, MA, MN
  - Airports: Newark, O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth
  - Airlines: Southwest, American, United

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI** ‚Äì Dashboard creation and data modeling  
- **Excel** ‚Äì Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **DAX** ‚Äì Custom calculations and KPIs  
- **Kaggle Dataset** ‚Äì Historical flight delay data

## üë• Team Contribution

This was a collaborative project as part of a course assignment. Each member contributed to different areas including:
- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- DAX formula development
- Visual layout and storytelling
- Final dashboard design and interpretation

---

## üí° Key Insights

- Almost **1 in 5 flights** experienced delays.
- The most common delay cause was related to **previous flights**.
- Delay patterns vary widely across **states, airlines, and airports**.
